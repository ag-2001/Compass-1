<span id="College">
<center><span class="bold">Why College?</span></center>
<br>
You might be thinking, why should I attend college?
And it’s true, college may not seem like a path you want to go down, but there are multiple reasons that prove earning a college degree is both beneficial and rewarding.
First off, college graduates make more money than those with high school diplomas. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed that in 2016, people with a college degree made around $1,156 a week while someone with a high school diploma earned just $692.
<br>
<br>
In addition to receiving a higher salary, acquiring a college degree also gives you more options when choosing a career. Most stable, good paying jobs that provide employee benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and dental care, require bachelor’s degrees. Plus, you can choose a major that you are passionate about and use your knowledge to give back to your community.
During your time at college, you will meet other students and network with professors, creating connections that can land you your first job and introduce you to different programs, internships, clubs, and scholarships. Maintaining the networks you form in college can help you throughout your professional career. Also there is a high possibility that you will attend a job fair, in which you will interact with different company recruiters and discuss future employment opportunities after college. Make sure to take down their contact info and give them your resume.
<br>
<br>
Being the first to attend college in your family can seem daunting, but you will be able to lead a better life with more opportunities for you and your family. If you take that first step and get a college degree, your children will be 71% more likely to go to college. College doesn't guarantee a perfect life, but it does make it easier to lead a stable life in which you can provide for those you love.

As you enter your senior year of high school, starting your college research early can really pay off in terms of staying on track and not getting stressed out while taking hard classes.
Compass’s recommendation for  you is to stay within a 12-15 school limit, while having a number of safety schools, reach schools, and dream schools.
It’s important to have a high number of safety schools in order to assure that you will have options when the college decisions are released.

Here is a step by step guide on conducting college research to create a list of schools you want to apply to.
<br>
<br>
1. Consider location. Do you want to stay in the same city that you grew up in? Same state? Or do you want to move across the country and attend school in a new place? This is an incredibly important factor in deciding what schools you want to apply to, since you will be staying in that area for the next few years.
<br>
<br>
2. Academics. Does the school offer the major or concentration of study that you are interested in? Contact the school or the professors to gain more information on the school.
<br>
<br>
3. Think about the size of the school. Do you prefer a small, medium, or large sized school? Would you prefer most of your classes to be in 300-student lecture halls or 20-students groups? Consider your learning style.
<br>
<br>
4. Social Scene. Do the schools have clubs or activities that involves your interests? Research what students at the school do for fun.

<br>

Firstly, <strong> financial aid </strong> helps subsidize college tuition for many college students, making college a possibility. It comes from federal and state governments, the college or university you attend, and private organizations.
So financial aid sounds great, but you’re probably wondering how it works. It all starts with completing the financial aid forms. Remember that applying for financial aid is different than applying for college; there are different deadlines and forms that must be met and submitted. <br>

<br>
<br>
Start off with completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This application gives you access to grants and scholarships, part-time work on campus, and loans. FAFSA application opens Oct 1. every year.

<br>
<br>
Another application is the  College Board's CSS PROFILE, which collects information from students and awards financial aid from sources outside the federal and state government, unlike FAFSA. <a href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/financial-aid-101/how-to-complete-the-css-financial-aid-profile"> More info about CSS </a>
<br>
<br>
<strong> Scholarships </strong> are also another way to subsidize college tuition. Scholarships are free money in which you do not have to pay back and are provided by schools, organizations, private companies, nonprofits, communities, religious groups, and professional and social organizations. Remember some scholarships require you to reapply yearly. <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/finding-scholarships"> Here are more details and general questions answered about scholarships.  </a>



There are numerous scholarships online. Try looking online and ask others about scholarships they applied to.
<a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51AiideP+aL._AC_US218_.jpg"> Here are some more scholarships that are specifically for first generation students. </a>


<br>
<br>
<strong> Student loans </strong> are money borrowed used to help pay for college and are paid back over time―with interest. Loans will often be part of your financial aid offer from the school you attend. However, we suggest you look for scholarships first, since they don't have to be repaid.
