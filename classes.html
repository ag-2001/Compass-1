To ensure a great future ahead it is helpful to learn good ways of managing the heavy loads of homework.
There are several methods and tools you can use to stay on track with school and organizational skills you can learn for college too.
If you are taking hard classes, it’s perfectly fine to ask for help when you need it! Reach out to students who have taken the same classes, teachers you connect to, or try out free tutoring services.
<br>
<br>

The classes we will be listing are classes that make you eligible for apply to college.
You might be passing your classes but are they the right classes for the colleges you want to apply to in the future.
They are better known as the A-G requirements, these classes are the minimum bar for apply to UC and CSU.
Some classes only require you to take the course for a certain amount of time but it's always recommended to take more years, to have a competitive transcript and gain more knowledge.
<br>
<br>
Although A-G requirements do not mention AP, IB, Honors courses, its always best to challenge yourself and take an advance class to boost your GPA and show universities that you are challenging yourself. However be aware that advance classes do have a much more work load, and can be more difficult than a regular, it's a great resource and can give you college credit (units).

There are several organizations that offer free tutoring services to help you in the classes you are taking. You can use a website called Tutor Chat Live or On Class Tutoring. Both of them offer aid to students and help you master the concepts you learn at school. Often times, your school will also have free tutoring through students or teachers volunteering their time. Ask your counselor for information on opportunities to finding help for your school work.
<br>
<br>
Another way to stay on task is to manage your time wisely by planning. It’s important to find your own outlet for personal planning. You can use <a href= "https://www.canva.com/create/personal-planners/" > Canva </a> or <a href= "https://www.mystudylife.com/"> My Study Life </a> or even a notebook to keep track of school work and make a thorough scheduling plan to manage your time effectively.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, make sure to have some fun! With a heavy load of schoolwork, finding a way to destress and relax is just as important as the hard work you put into keeping up your grades and studying. Participate in school sports, clubs, or do something that allows you to unwind and chill!
