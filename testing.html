<br>
<span class="bold">What is the SAT and ACT and why are these tests important?</span>
<br>
These tests are standardized exams, which are widely used by colleges for college admissions.
Although these tests may be intimidating, it is important to take them, since most colleges require them.
Which of these tests is right for you? These tests are very similar, but also have some significant differences.
If a factor such as time pressure is what you find most difficult, then you should probably take the SAT, because the ACT is more fast-paced.
However, if you prefer questions that may be a little longer but are more straightforward and easy to understand, you might want to take the ACT.
The biggest difference between SAT and ACT is that the ACT  has a Science Reasoning section. You can determine which test is best for you by taking both an SAT and ACT practice test and see which one you find easier.
Here is a chart with each of the sections and its time, for both of the tests.
<br>

<style>
table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
    border-collapse: collapse;
}
</style>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>SAT</th>
    <th>ACT</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reading | 52 questions - 65 minutes</td>
    <td>English | 75 questions - 45 minutes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Writing | 44 questions -  35 minutes</td>
    <td>Math (Calc) | 60 questions - 60 minutes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Math (No Calc) | 20 questions - 25 minutes</td>
    <td>Reading | 40 questions - 35 minutes </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Math (Calc) | 38 questions - 55 minutes</td>
    <td>Science | 40 questions - 35 minutes</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Essay (optional) | - 50 minutes</td>
    <td>Writing (optional) | - 40 minutes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Total time: 3 hours (without essay) | 3 hrs 50 min (with essay)</td>
    <td>Total time: 2 hours 55 min (without Writing) | 3 hrs 35 min (with Writing)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>
<br>
As you can see from the above chart, the SAT provides considerably more time per question, compared to the ACT.
However, the test is slightly longer than the ACT.

<span class="bold">How do I sign up for these tests?</span>
<br>
In order to sign up for the SAT or SAT Subject Tests (which will be discussed later on this page), create an account on <a href="https://www.collegeboard.org/"> College Board</a> and to sign up for the ACT create an account <a href="http://www.act.org"> here</a>.
<br>
What are some strategies for taking these tests?
<br>
<br>
The most important thing to remember when you take these is test is that there is no penalty for guessing. Therefore, if you are running out of time or just do not know what the answer is, you should guess because you have a 25% chance of getting it right. Also, take several full-length practice tests before you take the exam. Take your practice tests in a test environment- in a place with no distractions. Eat a proper breakfast before your test and bring snacks and water for the breaks in between the sections of the test. This will ensure that you remain focused during the exam.

<br>

<span class="bold">How do I study for the SAT/ACT?</span>
<br>
It is crucial to take a lot of practice tests when studying for the SAT/ACT. Practice tests ensure that you understand the format of the test and that you know the types of problems that will be given on the test.
You do not want to end up getting surprised on test day.
College Board has 8 released SAT tests online.
You may either use the online versions for free, or can buy The Official SAT Guide, 2018 Edition.
For the ACT, ACT has released 5 practice tests, for which you can find the practice tests online for free or by the official book: ACT Prep Book 2017-2018: Test Prep Book & Practice Test Questions for the English, Math, Reading, Science, and Writing Sections of the ACT Exam.
<br>
<br>
1. One of the best free websites to use to study for SAT is <a href=  "https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>. Since Khan Academy has a partnership with College Board, the company that makes the SAT, their practice material is closest to the real test. Khan Academy offers personalized practice based on your needs. Although this may not be enough to guarantee your goal score, it is free and does help strengthen the skills you are struggling with.
<div> <br>
2. You also might want to invest in a couple of books instead of paying thousands of dollars to a test prep center. You may also find these books at your local library, purchase used books online or reach out to others who have taken the SAT and borrow their books. These books are obviously not perfect, but they do help with mastering certain skills. Below are a list of books that will help you improve your reading, writing, and math skills. You don’t need to purchase all these books, one or two will suffice. You can also find some book available at your local library or ask peers or friends to borrow books they no longer use.</div>

<center><span class="bold"> Subject Tests </span></center>
Subject tests are a great way to show off your skills in a specific area. They are 60 minute tests on specific subjects such as chemistry, literature, math, and more. Subjects tests are taken to show their mastery of a certain topic.
There are not many schools that require subject tests, however for those that do, it’s best to invest in a preparation book from publisher such as Barron’s or Princeton Review.
You can find used ones online or rent them out from your local library! <a href= "<br>

AP courses are a great way to challenge yourself in your academia. Remember, AP courses in high school are equivalent to courses in college in terms of difficulty, so taking an excessive amount of AP courses can actually be counterproductive to you. If there is a particular AP course that your school offers and that interests you, it may be worth the extra work to take the course. Talk to the teachers at your school who teach the course and ask them for more information. <br>
<br>
AP tests are an opportunity for you to skip certain classes in college. After taking an AP course or self studying for AP tests, you can opt to take an AP test in order to skip that introductory course in college and move on to more challenging courses. An AP test is scored out of 5, and it involves a series of multiple choice and free response questions, depending on the subject. Generally a 3,4, and 5 are accepted by schools in order to skip the course in college, however be sure to review the college’s website to see what they accept. If you qualify for free or reduced lunch, yo

<br>
Additionally, AP tests can also provide your college with an example of your mastery in a specific subject. For example, getting a 5 on the AP Calculus Exam can help you in proving your love for math and why you want to pursue it.

In terms of studying for an AP test, your classes will usually spend the whole year preparing you for the way the test works and the material you need to cover. For extra preparation, you can use the College Board for free resources to prepare. The website offers a multitude of past AP exams for practice and the website Khan Academy has videos that cover all content for most of the AP exams.
